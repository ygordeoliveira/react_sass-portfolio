# React Sass Portf√≥lio - project

This project represents the my personal portfolio developed with React and pre-processor Sass.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites and Local Development

### `node -v`

When running this command, you will see the version of node that was installed on your computer. If you haven't installed node, go to the website: [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en). You will need to have node installed to run the project.

Node is a command line program, which means that it will run through your computer's terminal.

### `npm -v`

When running this command, you will be able to see what version of **npm** has been installed on your computer.

NPM (node package manager) is the node.js package manager, with NPM you can manage your project's dependencies, access the NPM repository and have access to numerous JavaScript libraries and frameworks, allowing installation/uninstallation of them as well as creating your own public or private modules. The npm is included along with nodeJS.

### Share Repository URL

Now that you already have node and npm installed, you will go to the repository where the project is and click on the < > Code part of Github.

The cloning options will open for you to clone on your machine and run the project.

You will choose in the option on HTTPS and copy the link that is in the field.
